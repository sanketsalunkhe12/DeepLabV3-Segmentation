#### Segmentation: 

Image segmentation can be formulated as a classification problem of pixels with semantic labels. Clustering parts of an image together that belong to the same object class. It is a pixel-level classification.

Semantic segmentation treats multiple objects within a single category as one entity. Instance segmentation, on the other hand, identifies individual objects within these categories. Semantic segmentation involves understanding what region of image those things are located in at a very grained level.
